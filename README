This is a simple Windows Script that will:

a) Remove existing AUTORUN.INF and create a directory with that name
b) Delete the RECYCLER directory and create a file with that name

In this way, since the files are system/readonly most of the viruses won't be able to inject their malicious code/binaries on the (USB usually) drive.

You can run this on any drive, by copying the script on it, and executing it.
